# Exercises

In this directory you will find the exercises for the workshop.

In the [code](./code) directory there's boilerplate code to get started. Open this directory in your code editor of choice.

In the terminal, try to run the starting code, it should output "Hello, world!" in the terminal. If you've opened a new terminal, don't forget to source the environment again!

```
source ~/export-esp.sh
cargo run
```

The exercises build on each other so start with [Exercise 1](./exercise_1).
